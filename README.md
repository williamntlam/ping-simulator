# 📡 ping-simulator

A simple web-based tool to simulate network latency and help you **feel** how long a delay like `200ms` actually is.

## 📝 Why I Built This

When working on **system design**, I realized it’s easy to talk about latency numbers like *“200ms”* or *“50ms”* without really appreciating what they feel like in practice.

I built **ping-simulator** to:
- 👀 Visualize and experience different latency values.
- 🧠 Build an intuition for how delays impact user experience.
- 🛠 Practice frontend implementation for simulating delays.

This tool helps developers and designers **understand the human perception of latency**, which is critical when making system design trade-offs.

## 🚀 Features
- Enter any latency value (e.g., `50ms`, `200ms`, `1s`).
- Simulate network delay by displaying a response after the specified time.
- Optionally extend it with sound effects or progress indicators for a richer experience.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- CSS3

---

## 🔥 Demo
```
Enter delay in ms: [200]
[ Simulate ]
```
🕒 After clicking “Simulate,” you’ll see a response after 200ms to help you feel the delay.

---

## 🤔 Future Improvements
- Add audio feedback (a “ping” sound after delay).  
- Show actual vs. expected delay.  
- Include a progress bar to visualize waiting time.  
- Mobile-friendly UI for quick testing on phones.

---

## 📌 Use Cases
- 🏗 Developers building latency-sensitive systems.  
- 🧪 UX designers exploring how delay impacts user experience.  
- 📝 Educators teaching concepts like network latency or API round-trip times.

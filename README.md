# 📡 ping-simulator

A simple web-based tool to simulate network latency and help you **feel** how long a delay like `200ms` actually is.

## 📝 Why I Built This

When studying **system design**, I realized I didn't have an intuitive feel for latency numbers like *“200ms”* or *“50ms”*.

I built **ping-simulator** to:
- 👀 Visualize and experience different latency values.
- 🧠 Build an intuition for how delays impact user experience.

This tool helps developers and designers **understand the human perception of latency**, which is critical when making system design trade-offs.

## 🚀 Features
- Enter any latency value (e.g., `50ms`, `200ms`, `1s`).
- Simulate network delay by displaying a response after the specified time.
- Optionally extend it with sound effects or progress indicators for a richer experience.

## 📌 Use Cases
- 🏗 Developers building latency-sensitive systems.  
- 🧪 UX designers exploring how delay impacts user experience.  
- 📝 Educators teaching concepts like network latency or API round-trip times.
